# Cloud.Notepad_App

This code can be used by any GitHub user. However, it will be absolutely useless in any software as some parts/functions of the code are personalized for our own software.

However, some of that parts/functions may be deleted or changed by any user.

Before the use of this code, you must know some things before starting:

  1. This is a calculator based code. It can be changed but remember that any string written in the <input> will be transformed.
  2. This software hasn't been tested as our project is still in development. For this reason, this code could create errors/malfunctions in your own code. However, as it's not finished, it will not change in a while.
  3. This code is developed for own software as I said. So it could not work properly without changing our/your code (or even doing it).

Thanks for reading.
